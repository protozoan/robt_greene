Modern spelling used mostly in accordance with Nina Green's transcriptions. 

Dual dating is shown for events which take place in the first three 
months of our modern year. For instance, 02 January 1592 Old Style would 
correspond to 02 January 1593 if we were to back-date today's calendar. 
The 1592/3 notation reminds that the date is after December 31, but the 
previous year was retained in those days.

1580       Harvey's THREE published 
1589       Greene's MENAPH is published with twelve-page 
             preface by Nashe. Nashe mentions Harvey by name, but 
             unclear (to me) if he is being complimentary or not.
1589       PAP appears. Harvey attributes it to Lyly, which seems 
             to be the modern attribution.
1589-10-23 Ricard Harvey's LAMB entered in S. R. (McKerrow, 1904, 
             vol. 5:75) An epistle found on some versions compares
             Nashe to a butler of the same name. The epistle 
             refers to MENAPH and PAP.
1589-11-05 Harvey composes ADVERT (McKerrow, 1904, vol. 5:74)
1589-11-06 Because of disreputable stage presentations featuring 
             Martin Mar-prelate, Burghley convenes a small committee 
             to review playscripts. The Admiral's Men had had promptly 
             ceased production when asked, but Lord Strange's Men 
             merely moved to another theatre. (Petheram, 1844, p. 48-50)
1591       Chettle, Danter, and Hoskins partners/

             Lynn?) from Norwich and soon dies (Lee, 1891).
1592-07-20 Greene's QUIP entered in S. R. printed by Wolfe. A short 
             attack on the Harvey brothers is included, but no extant

1592-08    (late August) Harvey lives with Wolfe

1592-08-29 Date of first Harvey letter in FOUR. Written by Bird, it 
             mentions QUIP in a postscript.

1592-09-03 Greene dies

1592-09-05 (ca.) Harvey's second letter apparently published in six 
             leaves (with eight more added later); the butterfly pamphlet
             Mentioned in STRANGE and SAFFRON. While no copy exists, this 
             would seem to be the first mention that Greene had died.
1592-09-08 -09 Date of third Harvey letter in FOUR. Harvey mentions 
             PIERCE.
1592-09-11 -12 Date of fourth Harvey letter in FOUR

1592-12-08 Chettle's KIND entered in S. R. by Wright, printed by Danter  
             and Wolfe.  Chettle appears as Greene's ghost "'advertised' 
             Nashe's STRANGE by urging Nashe to revenge himself on 
             Harvey for the publication of FOUR 
1593-01-12   (1592/3) Nashe's STRANGE entered in S. R. (McKerrow, 1904,

1593-04-28 Shakespeare's VENUS entered in S. R.
1593-05    Barnes' PARTH entered in S. R. It, too, has a dedication
             to Southampton that mentions worthless leaves. Nashe may be 
             parodying both Shakespeare and Barnes in UNFORT.
1593-05-30 Marlowe dies
1593-06-12 Stonley purchases a copy of VENUS 
1593-07-16 Harvey composes forward to SUPER. SUPER is nearly finished.

             vol. 5:68)
1593-07-27 Date of Nashe's UNFORT
1593-09    Nashe's UNFORT entered in the S. R.
1593       (ca. one year from 1592-09-16) Nashe composes SAFFRON. He 
             mentions Harvey's epistle to FOUR "a year ago." Detobel
             and Ligon (2009) point out that Nashe conflates THREE and 
             FOUR. For example, the "wellwiller's Epistle" occurs in 
             THREE, but Nashe claims it occurs "a year ago."
1593-09-16 Harvey composes NOTAB (Nicholl, 1992, p. 60, 64) 
1593-09-18 Shakerley is buried (Nicholl, 1992, p. 64) Nicholl argues that 
             Harvey must have heard of this death and uses Marlovian 
             style in NOTAB to commemorate it. Harvey has compared Nashe 
             to Shakerley before which is the reason that he pays notice 
             Shakerley. Nicholl points out that the prevailing wisdom had 
             been that Harvey was writing about Marlowe.
1593-09    (ca. end of month) Nashe's CHRIST appears, printed by James 
             Roberts and sold by Andrew Wise at Paul's churchyard. Nashe 
             offers a truce with Harvey, but warns that much that he has
             written is already at the printers.
1593-09    (after) Nashe is jailed for a while because of CHRIST. He then
             lives with Carey.
1593-10    (autumn per Charlton, 1918, p.396. October per Steere, 2010) 
             Harvey's SUPER appears with NOTAB included (Nicholl, 1992, 
             p. 60)
1593-11-13 Carey in a letter to his wife describes Nashe's present misery 
             in prison over what he wrote in CHRIST (Lamb, 1999)
1594-02    (1593/4) Nashe's UNFORT published.
1596       Appearance of SAFFRON
