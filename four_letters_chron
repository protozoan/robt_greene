Chronology of events surrounding the publishing of Gabriel Harvey's 
Four Letters and Certain Sonnets

Copyright and credit for all research to Nina Green,

I attempt to add citations to notes not found in Nina Green's summaries.  
In case of discrepancy, consult her summaries. 

Modern spelling mostly used in accordance with Nina Green's transcriptions. 

For clarity I include dual dating notation (e. g. 1592/3, Old Style / New 
Style) for dates between 1 January and 25 March which the Elizabethans would 
have continued to call the previous year. Some modern historians might use 
1 January as the date to switch to the new year. Equally problematic is the 
ten day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. In some cases 
it may be unclear whether the modern historian has converted both the year 
and month-day or has created a hybrid with the Julian month-day and the 
modern year. The intent in the present case is to include the Julian date or 
at least add a clarifying note if this intent cannot be carried out.

1577-02    (1577/8) Tylney acts as Master of the Revels
1578-07    Harvey delivers GRATUL. He calls on Edward de Vere to set 
             down his pen and take up arms.
1579-07    Tylney formally becomes Master of the Revels
1579-11-03 Stubbs and Page dismembered for publishing a pamphlet on 
             the Queen's marriage prospects.
1580-04-06 Dover Straits earthquake occurs.
1580-06-19 Date of epistle to Harvey's THREE. Harvey's poem SPECULUM 
           seems to mock Edward de Vere. Harvey admits as much in his 
           private notebook (extant). 
1580-10-03 Greene's MAMIL1 entered in the S. R.  Earliest example
             is dated 1583.
1583       Earliest example of Greene's MAMIL1 (registered in 1580) 
             is dated 1583.
1583-09-16 Greene's MAMIL2 entered in the S. R.  Earliest example 
             is dated 1593. It contains a parody of Harvey's 
             SPECULUM from THREE.
1584       COMMONWEALTH appears
1586-10-17 Sir Philip Sidney dies.
1586-02-08 (1586/7) Execution of Mary Queen of Scots
1586-02-16 (1586/7) Funeral of Sir Philip Sidney 
1588-07-19 Armada spotted approaching England
1588-08-09 Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury promises a famous victory.
1588-09    Armada dissipated in the North Sea.
1588-09-04 Leicester dies 
1589       Greene's MENAPH is published with twelve-page 
             preface by Nashe. Nashe mentions Harvey by name, but 
             unclear (to me) if he is being complimentary or not.
1589       PAP appears. Harvey later attributes it to Lyly, which 
             seems to be the modern attribution. The author takes 
             time from belittling "Mar-prelate" to attack an 
             author who had published a familiar piece about the 
             earthquake (certainly Harvey in THREE). The author 
             states tha he has been trying to "lambacke" Harvey for 
             ten years.
1589-09    Watson stabs Bradley who had been fighting with Marlowe on 
             the Hog Lane.
1589-09    Last of the "Mar-Prelate" letters
1589-10-01 Marlowe released (wikipedia.org, Christopher Marlowe)
1589-10-23 Ricard Harvey's LAMB entered in S. R. (McKerrow, 1904, 
             vol. 5:75). An epistle found on some versions compares
             Nashe to a butler of the same name. The epistle 
             refers to Greene's MENAPH and PAP. One idea is that the 
             epistle was added later. Nashe in SAFFRON accuses 
             Gabriel Harvey of writing LAMB.
1589         (late) PERCEVALL (by Richard Harvey?) appears.
1589-11-05 Harvey composes ADVERT (McKerrow, 1904, vol. 5:74) 
1589-11-06 Because of disreputable stage presentations featuring 
             "Mar-prelate", Burghley convenes a small committee to 
             review playscripts. The Admiral's Men promptly cease 
             production when asked, but Lord Strange's Men merely move 
             to another theatre (Petheram, 1844, p. 48-50).
1589-12-03 Marlowe and Watson discharged from Newgate prison following 
             September incident.
1591       Chettle, Danter, and Hoskins are partners.
1591       (summer) Marlowe and Kyd share a room.
1591-07-04 Edward de Vere sells the Great Garden property at Aldgate
             to Francis Trentham
1591-01-26 (1591/2) In a letter from Robert Sidney to Burghley, Baines 
             accuses Marlowe of counterfeiting coins in Flushing, 
             Netherlands (wikipedia, Richard Baines). 
1592-06-26 Southwell captured (Sweeney, 2006, p. 257).
1592-07    Gabriel's brother John Harvey returns home to Lynn (King's
             Lynn?) from Norwich and soon dies (Lee, 1891).
1592-07-20 Greene's QUIP entered in S. R. printed by Wolfe. A short 
             attack on the Harvey brothers is included, but no extant 
             copy contains this. 
1592-08-08 Nashe's PIERCE entered in S. R.  Nashe ridicules Richard 
             Harvey.
1592-08    (late August) Harvey lives with Wolfe
1592-08-21 CONEYREPENT entered in S. R. by Danter. The Browne material 
             appears as Greene's BLACK. Greene's BLACK is printed by 
             Danter for Nelson, but the Mourton material is apparently 
             never printed. Perhaps this material becomes Greene's 
             REPENT.
1592-08-29 Widow of Gabriel Harvey's brother, John, awarded estate 
             administration (McKerrow, 1904, vol. 5:80) 
1592-08-29 Date of first Harvey letter in FOUR. Written by Bird, it 
             mentions Greene's QUIP in a postscript.
1592-09    ca. { vv  London theatres closed  vv } (Charlton, 1918, p. 396)
1592-09-03 Greene dies
1592-09-05 Date of second Harvey letter in FOUR. 
1592-09-05 (ca.) Harvey's second letter apparently published in six 
             leaves (with eight more added later)--the butterfly pamphlet.
             Mentioned in Nashe's STRANGE and Nashe's SAFFRON. While no 
             copy exists, this would seem to be the first mention that 
             Greene had died.
1592-09-08 -09 Date of third Harvey letter in FOUR. Harvey mentions Nashe's
             PIERCE.
1592-09-11 -12 Date of fourth Harvey letter in FOUR
1592-09-16 Date of Harvey's dedicatory epistle in FOUR
1592-09-20 Greene's GROAT entered in S. R. by Wright at peril of Chettle,
             printed by Wolfe with Danter. Links "Shake-scene" with 
             Henry VI.
1592-10    Nashe stays with Whitgift at Croydon and produces SUMMER 
             (wikipedia.org, Thomas Nashe)
1592-10-06 Greene's REPENT entered in S. R. by Danter. Printed for Burbie 
               with a forward by C. B.  Greene's letter to his wife differs
               from that which will be printed by Harvey in FOUR.
1592-10-12 Gabriel Harvey becomes administrator of his brother John's 
             estate (McKerrow, 1904, vol.5:80)
1592-12    ca. { ^^  End of London theatre closing  ^^ } (Charlton, 1918, 
             p. 396)
1592-12-04 Harvey's FOUR entered in S. R. printed by Wolfe
             Harvey unacquainted with Greene
             1592-08-29 First of Harvey's letters
               Harvey mentions in postscript that he has read QUIP, and 
               a sonnet mentions that Greene is sick. 
             1592-09-05 Second Harvey letter
               Harvey learns of Greene's death mid-letter
             1592-09-08 -09 Third Harvey letter

             1592-09-16 Harvey's dedicatory epistle
1592-12-08 Chettle's KIND entered in S. R. by Wright, printed by Danter  
             and Wolfe.  Chettle appears as Greene's ghost "'advertised' 
             Nashe's STRANGE by urging Nashe to revenge himself on 
             Harvey for the publication of FOUR 
1593         Earliest example of Greene's MAMIL2 (registered in 1583) is 
               dated 1593. Mocks a poem found in Harvey's THREE from 
               1580, SPECULUM.
1593-01-12   (1592/3) Nashe's STRANGE entered in S. R. (McKerrow, 1904, 
               vol. 5:88)
1593-02-24 Henry de Vere born to Edward de Vere
1593-03-31 Henry de Vere, son of Edward de Vere, baptised in Stoke 
             Newington
1593-04-27 Date of Harvey's SUPER (McKerrow, 1904, vol 5:88)  
1593-04-28 Shakespeare's VENUS entered in S. R. (18 April per Farmer, 
             1899, p. x)
1593-05    Barnes' PARTH entered in S. R. It, too, has a dedication
             to Southampton that mentions worthless leaves. Nashe may be 
             parodying both Shakespeare and Barnes in UNFORT.
1593-05-12 Kyd turns in Marlowe over heretical papers found in his 
             possesion.
1593-05-18 Warrant isssued by Privy Council for Marlowe.
1593-05-20 Marlowe is commanded to visit the Council daily
1593-05    (late? [1]) Baines declares Marlowe an atheist.
1593-05-30 Marlowe dies

1593-06-30 Nashe's TERRORS entered in S. R. (Farmer, 1899, p. ix)
1593-07-16 Harvey composes forward to SUPER. SUPER is nearly finished.  
             (McKerrow, 1904, vol. 5:88) SUPER appears together with 
             ADVERT from 1589, printed by Wolfe.
1593-07-25 Gabriel's father John Harvey is buried (McKerrow, 1904, 
             vol. 5:68)
1593-07-27 Date of Nashe's UNFORT, found at the end of the story.
1593-09    Nashe's UNFORT entered in the S. R.
1593       (ca. one year from 1592-09-16) Nashe composes SAFFRON. He 
             mentions Harvey's epistle to FOUR "a year ago." Detobel
             and Ligon (2009) point out that Nashe conflates THREE and 
             FOUR. For example, the "wellwiller's Epistle" occurs in 
             THREE, but Nashe claims it occurs "a year ago." SAFFRON 
             appears in 1596.
1593-09-16 Harvey composes NOTAB (Nicholl, 1992, p. 60, 64) 
1593-09-18 Shakerley is buried (Nicholl, 1992, p. 64) Nicholl argues that 
             Harvey must have heard of this death and uses Marlovian 
             style in NOTAB to commemorate it. Harvey has compared Nashe 
             to Shakerley before which is the reason that he pays notice 
             to Shakerley. Nicholl points out that the prevailing wisdom 
             had been that Harvey was writing about Marlowe.
1593-09    (ca. end of month) Nashe's CHRIST appears, printed by James 
             Roberts and sold by Andrew Wise at Paul's churchyard. Nashe 
             offers a truce with Harvey, but warns that much that he has
             written is already at the printers.
1593-09    (after) Nashe is jailed for a while because of CHRIST. He then
             lives with George Carey.
1593-10    (autumn per Charlton, 1918, p.396. October per Steere, 2010) 
             Harvey's SUPER appears with NOTAB included (Nicholl, 1992, 
             p. 60)
1593-11-13 George Carey in a letter to his wife describes Nashe's present 
             misery in prison over what he wrote in CHRIST (Lamb, 1999)
1593-12-14 Radcliffe, patron of Sussex's Men, dies (luminarium.org, Radcliffe)

1594-12-27 -28 Date of performance before the Queen. Payment the next 15 March.
1594-02    (1593/4) Nashe's UNFORT appears, printed by T. Scarlet for 
             C[uthbert?] Burby. Early editions have a dedication to 
             Southampton which seems to parody or mimic Shakespeare's 
             dedication in VENUS.
1594-02-21 (1594/5) Southwell executed.
1594-03-15 (1594/5) Payment by Treasurer of the Chamber to Kempe, Shakespeare,

             for the provision of the crews, per letter of 1594-11-08.
1594-11-08 Frobisher describes the eventually fatal wound he has received in 
             the siege of Spanish forces at Brest, France.

1599       Call by the authorities to destroy all copies of Harvey-Nashe quarrel.

Notes

[1] Three versions exist of Baines's letter denouncing Marlowe. The most original
    seems to have been written before Marlowe died. Two others (versions 
    supposedly sent to the Queen) mention Marlowe's death:

    "A note conteyning the opinion of one Christofer Marlye concernynge his 
    damnable opinion and Judgment of Relygion and scorne of Gods worde, who since 
    Whitsundy dyed a suden and violent deathe."

    and

    "A note delived on whitsun eve last of the most horrible blasphemes and 
    damnable opinions uttered by xxofer marly who within iij dayes after came to 
    a suden & fearfull ende of his life."

    Easter seems to have been 15 April in early 1593 (following the Julian 
    reckoning). Whitsun should then be 3 June (seven Sundays past Easter or eight 
    Sundays including Easter). If Marlowe died on 30 May, that would seem to be 
    before and not after Whitsun.
